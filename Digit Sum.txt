#A- Digit Sum ->(REFERENCE TO CODEFORCES)

Let's define S(x) to be the sum of digits of number x written in decimal system. For example, S(5)=5, S(10)=1, S(322)=7.

We will call an integer x interesting if S(x+1)<S(x). In each test you will be given one integer n. 
Your task is to calculate the number of integers x such that 1≤x≤n and x is interesting.

# LOGIC ->
	
	The logic of the question is simple and I will explain in two steps -

  	1)- If 'n' is greater than or equal to 1 AND less than or equal to 8, then answer is 0. 
	    Else if 'n' equals to 9, then answer is 1.

	2)- If 'n' is greater than or equal to 10, then if its last digit is less than 9, answer is n/10.
	    Else if last digit is equal to 9, answer is (n/10)+1.
